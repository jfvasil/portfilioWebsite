# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my Portfolio Website repository! This project showcases my work as a software developer and provides a glimpse into my skills, projects, and achievements. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this one-page website serves as a platform to present my portfolio to potential employers, clients, and collaborators.

- **styles.css**: The CSS file that defines the visual styles and layout of the website.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that handles any interactive elements or dynamic functionality on the website.
- **assets**: This folder contains any additional assets, such as images, icons, or fonts, used in the project.
